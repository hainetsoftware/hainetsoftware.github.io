Listen to me - - > THIS IS A TEST. THIS IS NOT A REAL PROJECT.     
Now, repeat with me. THIS IS A TEST. THIS IS NOT A REAL PROJECT.
#### Nice, now you understand it, I hope.

## Is this site useful?
Well, in short. What's the point of creating a QR Generator if you can't even print the QR?
It is urgent to make an Update where we add the printing functionality (in PDF, PNG or just from the printer).

## Native app
Coming soon lmao

# Changelog
Various changes from version to version will be written below.
